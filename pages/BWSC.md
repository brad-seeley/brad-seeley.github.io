## BWSC - TeamArrow solar car


I have spent 4 years as a member of TeamArrow Racing Association, a volunteer-run group in Brisbane that competes in the biennial Bridgestone World Solar Challenge (BWSC). 
<br>

In my first year, the team was modifying and racing previous vehicles, but from 2020 we started designing and building a new car (the teamsâ€™ third vehicle). 
We raced this car in October 2023, despite our reduced budgets from previous attempts. 
<br>

During my time at TeamArrow I spent 2 years as President and 1 year as Treasurer. 
<br>

I led the steering installation, based on my thesis as listed earlier. 
I was also responsible for the engineering approval of the occupant cell, simulating front, side and rollover impacts in ANSYS and SolidWorks FEA tools. 
I was one of the active members in building all parts of the car, from the chassis, crossmembers, suspension, aero body, brakes, steering, and driver controls.
