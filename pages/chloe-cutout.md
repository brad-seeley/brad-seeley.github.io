### A gift for my partner - making her dog in timber


In January my partner Jess and I celebrated our five year anniversary. <br>
While we are enjoying living in London, we both (understandably) miss a few things from home. One of these things that Jess misses is her dog, Chloe. 
<br>

As a gift for this occassion, I wanted to make something sentimental - we already buy enough chocolates as it is!
<br>

I was initially inspired by the 3D bandsaw reindeer, however after hours of CAD I still couldn't make it resemble a dog using cuts in only three dimensions. 
It was soon the day before the anniversary, and I had to get it moving. 
<br>

I finished the 2D profile, before heading to my local workshop. I found some suitable timber, printed the design on A4 paper, and glued it to the wood. 
After some time setting up, and ensuring the bandsaw blade had adequate tension, I cut the mini-Chloe out based on the pupper-profile. 
<br> 

The initial block of timber was far too thick, making Chloe resemble the Michelin man. <br>
I passed it through the bandsaw using the fence, taking thin offcuts until I got to a width I was happy with. 
_(This had the added benefit of making multiple chloe cutouts!)_
Finally I sanded the surfaces and edges, and added varnish as a surface finish.
<br>

The next day when I gave it to Jess, she was totally surprised and, more importantly, very happy with her miniature Chloe.
