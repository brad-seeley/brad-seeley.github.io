## BWSC - TeamArrow solar car


I have spent 4 years as a member of TeamArrow Racing Association, a volunteer-run group in Brisbane that competes in the biennial Bridgestone World Solar Challenge (BWSC). 

In my first year, the team was modifying and racing previous vehicles, but from 2020 we started designing and building a new car (the teamsâ€™ third vehicle). We raced this car in October 2023, despite our reduced budgets from previous attempts. 

During my time at TeamArrow I spent 2 years as President and 1 year as Treasurer. 


I led the steering installation, based on my thesis as listed earlier. I was also responsible for the engineering approval of the occupant cell, simulating front, side and rollover impacts in ANSYS and SolidWorks FEA tools. I was one of the active members in building all parts of the car, from the chassis, crossmembers, suspension, aero body, brakes, steering, and driver controls.
