### A fun journey into making my own glasses frames (still in progress)


In April I managed to break my favourite pair of glasses. 
15 months earlier, I ordered a cheap pair online as backups, but they quickly became my favourite specs. <br>
Come April when they were broken, I had to resort to my less comfortable (but more expensive) pair. 
<br>

One thing that I found great about ordering these glasses online is that they came with a spare pair of lenses! 
Great since I usually end up damaging my lenses by dropping them or somehow scratching them up (this will come again later). 
<br>

After I broke the frame of my glasses, I foolishly threw them out, thinking I could not make any use of the remains. <br>
While procrastinating ordering replacements online, I remembered these spare lenses, and decided to make my own frames. 
The goal was to make something simple, that I could make with relative precision (not hand carved), using tools available at my local Hackspace (or Makerspace). 
Later revisions could add features like hinges, but for v1, simplicity was the name of the game. 
<br>

Taking a photo of the lens, with a ruler in frame to use for scale, I was able to use this as the basis for a CAD sketch. <br>
I used [photopea.com](photopea) (an online photoshop alternative) to remove the backgrounds and isolate just the ruler and the outer profile that I needed. <br>

<br>

Then using SolidWorks, I imported the picture using the Sketch Picture tool (sketch -> Tools/Sketch Tools/Sketch Picture), and drew a spline along the profile. <br>
Then copying that curve using the Offset Entities feature, I created the outer part of the frame. Adding a centreline, I mirrored these components to make the other side, before drawing a nose bridge and side wings to attach the arms.
This version, v1, was 3 laser cut parts, that could initally be glued together. The frame needed some adjustment to fit the lenses, but v1 was a success. <br>

<br>

When adding the lenses, I thought I must have had my prescription backwards, or maybe my eyes had changed. Sadly upon further inspection, I noticed these were not prescription lenses, merely the display lenses that the glasses were manufactured with. 
While the people I had shown the first prototype to were very supportive, saying things like "oh they will still make nice safety glasses", it wasn't what I was looking for this time. <br>
Fortunately for me, these were cheap glasses, so I ordered a full replacement set online from [SmartBuyGlasses](smartbuyglasses.co.uk), so that I could have some proper lenses to test with. 
<br>
These fit well, and I was quite happy when I had glued the frame together, but more work was needed.

For v2 I decided it needed to be easier to assemble the glasses, but I wanted to get a comfortable frame profile before adding more complexity. <br>
This saw me using a mortise & tenon system to join the arms to the frame. This worked well, where I could assemble the glasses without glue and still have a strong structure. <br>
I also re-sketched the lens drawing, making it wider than v1, as I hadn't accounted for the extra thickness that my full prescription would add. <br>

V3 and beyond is still yet to come. The list of features to be added are: 
- some type of simple hinge mechanism. 
- test (even) wider lens cutout, vs instepped rabbet cut from the router. 
- Thinner or different materials. 

Watch this space.
