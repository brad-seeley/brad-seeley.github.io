### Design of steering system for 3-wheeled solar vehicle <br> Undergraduate Thesis project


As an avid member of TeamArrow Racing Association, I partnered with my university to complete my thesis on researching an innovative steering system for the upcoming vehicle. 
<br>
This involved collecting information across industries, applications, and technologies to determine a suitable and successful design. The key criteria from TeamArrow were safety, reliability, light-weight, and low cost. 
<br>
While the team had previously used rack+pinion systems with success, the system of choice was cable-driven, to best achieve the criteria.

**Grade: High Distinction (>85%)**
