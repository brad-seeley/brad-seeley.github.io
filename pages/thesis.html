<h2><strong>Undergraduate Thesis:</strong>
Design of steering system for 3-wheeled solar vehicle.
</h2>

<p>
As an avid member of TeamArrow Racing Association, I partnered with my university to complete my thesis on researching an innovative steering system for the upcoming vehicle. 
This involved collecting information across industries, applications, and technologies to determine a suitable and successful design. The key criteria from TeamArrow were safety, reliability, light-weight, and low cost. 
While the team had previously used rack+pinion systems with success, the system of choice was cable-driven, to best achieve the criteria.
