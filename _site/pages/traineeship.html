<p>I completed a Certificate II in Engineering in 2012-13, working one day per week while studying. 
A certificate IV in Engineering is the qualification achieved from a Fitter apprenticeship. 
<br /></p>

<p>This role saw me fault-finding and repairing items in the Redcliffe Hospital (Qld, Australia). 
Items ranged from small scale office chairs, trolleys, and lots of hospital beds, up to servicing and maintaining site power generation, cooling towers, and boilers. 
<br /></p>

<p>During this time, the government mandated the cataloguing of all assets. 
Every piece of hospital equipment had to be IDâ€™d when it came through the workshop and pass a compliance inspection (provided by senior department). 
When conducting inspections, I found 2 additional checks that were later implemented to the inspection regime across the region. 
<br /></p>

<p>Completing my Certificate II meant I was trained on all manner of workshop equipment, including mills, lathes, drills, welding (MIG, TIG, stick, Oxy), hand tools, sheet metal, and more.
