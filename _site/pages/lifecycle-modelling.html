      <h3 id="lifecycle-cost-modelling">Lifecycle cost modelling</h3>

<p>Working as an analyst, I have been developing performance and lifecycle cost models for over 6 years. 
These are primarily for mining clients and assets, but some in defence and aviation. <br /></p>

<p>As I was in consulting, we worked on 6-12 week projects, delivering quick analysis to guide clients in deccision making. <br />
To deliver valuable information in this short time, it was important to quickly adapt to each customerâ€™s situation - no two projects were ever the same! <br /></p>

<p>Each project would have its own quirks, and that meant choosing the correct analysis method and tools. 
I would often learn new software/tools to deliver information within a project, going from a student to teacher within the 6-week scope. <br />
That said, most of the projects were heavily based around Microsoft Excel, where I have spent the most time. <br /></p>

<p>Lifecycle cost modelling in Excel is straightforward and can include a lot of simple configuration options - inflation, time-value, tax deferences, CAPEX/OPEX management, and more. <br />
The lifecycle costs are also built from a first-principle approach, using task lists to generate a comprehensive set of costs for equipment. <br /></p>

<p>See below some examples of Lifecycle modelling and component life forecasts.</p>
