<p>To prepare for BWSC23 I worked with the certifying engineer to prove that our vehicle was safe for use in competition and on public roads. 
I was responsible for proving the integrity of the occupant cell, among other systems. 
<br /></p>

<p>The chassis of the vehicle was made of aluminium honeycomb and the roll hoop was mild steel. 
Both were modelled in ANSYS and SolidWorks, running linear and non-linear analyses, and mesh refinement studies were required to ensure driver safety. 
While ANSYS analysis was used where possible, systems with complex geometry were analysed in SolidWorks to simplify the process. 
<br /></p>

<p>I identified a weakness in the existing roll hoop, then designed and proposed a fix to ensure the system was suitable. 
<br /></p>

<p>The final car was certified by our certifying engineer following my changes. 
<br /></p>
