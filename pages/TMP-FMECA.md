### TMP/FMECA development


Development of maintenance plans for clients for existing equipment. 
These were built from first-principles using FMECAs, then grouping and turning into actionable maintenance plans. 
<br>

Example assets include: 
- Lifting equipment (hoists, jib & gantry cranes)
- Conveyor dewatering systems
- High Voltage power distribution systems
- Bulk Fuel & Lube Storage
