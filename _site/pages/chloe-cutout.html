      <h3 id="a-gift-for-my-partner---making-her-dog-in-timber">A gift for my partner - making her dog in timber</h3>

<p>In January my partner Jess and I celebrated our five year anniversary. <br />
While we are enjoying living in London, we both (understandably) miss a few things from home. One of these things that Jess misses is her dog, Chloe. 
<br /></p>

<p>As a gift for this occassion, I wanted to make something sentimental - we already buy enough chocolates as it is!
<br /></p>

<p>I was initially inspired by the popular <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/search?q=bandsaw+reindeer">3D bandsaw reindeer</a>, however after hours of CAD I still couldnâ€™t make it resemble a dog using cuts in only three dimensions. <br />
It was soon the day before the anniversary, and I had to get it moving. 
<br /></p>

<p>I finished the 2D profile, before heading to my local workshop. I found some suitable timber, printed the design on A4 paper, and glued it to the wood. 
After some time setting up, and ensuring the bandsaw blade had adequate tension, I cut the mini-Chloe out based on the pupper-profile. 
<br /></p>

<p>The initial block of timber was far too thick, making Chloe resemble the Michelin man. <br />
I passed it through the bandsaw using the fence, taking thin offcuts until I got to a width I was happy with 
<em>(this had the added benefit of making multiple chloe cutouts!)</em> <br />
Finally I sanded the surfaces and edges, and added varnish as a surface finish.
<br /></p>

<p>The next day when I gave it to Jess, she was totally surprised and, more importantly, very happy with her miniature Chloe.</p>
