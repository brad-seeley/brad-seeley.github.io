### Lifecycle cost modelling

Working as an analyst, I have been developing performance and lifecycle cost models for over 6 years. 
These are primarily for mining clients and assets, but some in defence and aviation. <br>



As I was in consulting, we worked on 6-12 week projects, delivering quick analysis to guide clients in deccision making. <br>
To deliver valuable information in this short time, it was important to quickly adapt to each customer's situation - no two projects were ever the same! <br>

Each project would have its own quirks, and that meant choosing the correct analysis method and tools. 
I would often learn new software/tools to deliver information within a project, going from a student to teacher within the 6-week scope. <br>
That said, most of the projects were heavily based around Microsoft Excel, where I have spent the most time. <br>

Lifecycle cost modelling in Excel is straightforward and can include a lot of simple configuration options - inflation, time-value, tax deferences, CAPEX/OPEX management, and more. <br>
The lifecycle costs are also built from a first-principle approach, using task lists to generate a comprehensive set of costs for equipment. <br>

See below some examples of Lifecycle modelling and component life forecasts.
