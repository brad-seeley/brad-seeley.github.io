### Python plotly-dash web dashboard


In a 10-week project, I worked in a pair delivering a web dashboard for a client to visualise conditions of the longwall mining coal face in real-time.
<br>

We built this dashboard using functional programming principles, piping commands together so that the function components could be reuseable.
<br>

This 10-week project meant that we had quick iterations, short git branch life, and had to maintain product functionality to show consistent progress.
